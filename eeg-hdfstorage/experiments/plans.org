* eeg-hdfstorage experiments
** downsampling
*** resampy vs scikit.samplerate vs scipy.*poly
So far I am using scikit.samplerate but I need to use the github version
resampy may be fine if we convert to float32 first

This might make sense to go into eegml-signal but maybe not
**** experiments to try [0/2]
- [ ] do head-to-head comparison
- [ ] try convert vs no conver to float32 for resampy

** clipping
** interfacing with signals processing
** convenience function
** provenance/history tracking
** multi-record files
** annotation sets
** [ ] converters [0/0]
*** [X] tuh edf to eeg.h5
At least the basics of this conversion is done and applied t the the TUH seizure corpus
